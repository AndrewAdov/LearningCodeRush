    This project (CapsModifier) contains source files to help you learn
    CodeRush features, as well as the shortcuts that invoke them.

    For an optimal learning experience, enable Rich Comments. 
    
    If enabled, you will see the DevExpress logo below:

    ![](DevExpress;www.devexpress.com )

    If not, you'll see only markdown (enable Rich Comments in the 
    CodeRush *Options* dialog on the *Quick Setup* page).
     
    Gear icons in this solution can be clicked to bring up 
    CodeRush options pages, like this:

    ![](Gear;crcommand:Options:Quick Setup) << Quick Setup page.

    For the best experience working through this solution, enable the 
    "Hide comment delimiters" option on the Rich Comments options page.

    ![](HideCommentDelimiters;crcommand:Options:Editor\All Languages\Rich Comments)

    ![](Gear;crcommand:Options:Editor\All Languages\Rich Comments) << Rich Comments settings.

    Finally, run the Setup Wizard if you haven't yet. It's a fast way 
    to enable or disable major CodeRush features for the way you work.
    Many of the features in this solution rely upon Caps as a Modifier, 
    so make sure you enable that in the Setup Wizard (if it's not already 
    enabled):

    //`+Markers
    /*
      Some features create code in *new locations* (and take 
      you there so you can see the new code). 
    
      Before shifting the view, CodeRush drops a marker so you 
      can get back.

      To get back, press Escape (or Alt+End).

      ![](Gear;crcommand:Options:Editor\All Languages\Markers) << Marker settings.

    //`+Target Picker
    /*
      Some features let you decide where code will be placed 
      using a target picker. The target picker looks like this:

      ![](TargetPicker)

      The red horizontal line lets you specify where the new code 
      will go. Move it up or down with the Up/Down arrows. Press
      Enter to accept the location. Escape cancels.
