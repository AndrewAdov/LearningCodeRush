	/* 
	Caps+Space is a toggling/conversion tool for your code.

	Use Caps+Space to compress to (or expand from):

		* Implicit/Explicit Declarations
		* Expression Bodies
		* Ternary Expressions
		* Null Coalescing Operations
		* Initializers

	And you can use Caps+Space to flatten conditionals, inline 
	temporary variables, simplify expressions, convert procedures 
	to functions, expand lambda functions, and more!
