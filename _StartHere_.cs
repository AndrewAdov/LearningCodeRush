    This project (CapsModifier) contains source files to help you learn
    CodeRush features, as well as the shortcuts that invoke them.

    For an optimal learning experience, enable Rich Comments. 
    
    If enabled, you will see the DevExpress logo below:

    ![](DevExpress;www.devexpress.com )

    If not, you'll see only markdown (enable Rich Comments in the 
    CodeRush *Options* dialog on the *Quick Setup* page).
     
    Gear icons in this solution can be clicked to bring up 
    CodeRush options pages, like this:

    ![](Gear;crcommand:Options:Quick Setup) << Quick Setup page.

    For the best experience working through this solution, enable the 
    "Hide comment delimiters" option on the Rich Comments options page.

    ![](HideCommentDelimiters;crcommand:Options:Editor\All Languages\Rich Comments)

    ![](Gear;crcommand:Options:Editor\All Languages\Rich Comments) << Rich Comments settings.

    Finally, run the Setup Wizard if you haven't yet. It's a fast way 
    to enable or disable major CodeRush features for the way you work.
    Many of the features in this project rely upon Caps as a Modifier, 
    so make sure you enable that in the Setup Wizard (if it's not already 
    enabled):
    
    
                ![](CodeRushSetup;crcommand:RunSetupWizard)  << Click to run the Setup Wizard

		Note that while the examples in this project highlight fast ways to 
		instantly invoke your favorite refactorings and code generations, all 
		of these features and more can be accessed through Visual Studio's 
		Code Action menu by hitting Ctrl+Dot or Num 0 (if enabled in the Setup 
		Wizard).
