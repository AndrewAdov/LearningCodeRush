    This project (CapsModifier) contains source files to help you learn
    CodeRush features, as well as the shortcuts that invoke them.

    For an optimal learning experience, enable Rich Comments. 
    
    If enabled, you will see the DevExpress logo below:

    ![](DevExpress;www.devexpress.com )

    If not, you'll see only markdown (enable Rich Comments in the 
    CodeRush Options dialog on the Quick Setup page).
     
    Also, gear icons can be clicked to bring up the corresponding 
    CodeRush options page, like this:

    //`+Markers
    /*
      Some features create code in a new location (and take 
      you there so you can see the new code). Before shifting
      the view, CodeRush drops a marker so you can get back.

      A marker usually appears as a triangle in the code and 
      looks like this:
                            ![](Marker)

      To get back to where you were, press Escape 
      (or Alt+Shift+Home).

      To change marker settings, open this CodeRush options page:
    
        Editor | All Languages | Markers ![](Gear;crcommand:Options:Editor\All Languages\Markers)
         

      To learn more about Markers, check out this short video:

    //`+Target Picker
    /*
      Some features let you decide where code will be placed 
      using a target picker. The target picker looks like this:

      ![](TargetPicker)

      The red horizontal line lets you specify where the new code 
      will go. Move it up or down with the Up/Down arrows. Press
      Enter to accept the location. Escape cancels.
