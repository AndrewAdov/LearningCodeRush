/*
	This solution includes project-based CodeRush setting overrides to ensure 
	a smoother learning experience.

	These overrides may differ from your actual settings, which means features 
	may work in this solution while still being disabled in other solutions.

	The following settings have been overridden and may be different from 
	your defaults:

	![](Gear;crcommand:Options:Quick Setup;;0.015,0.015) << Rich Comments, Markers, and Smart Cut/Copy are enabled.

	Don't forget to run the Setup Wizard if you haven't yet. It's a fast 
	way to enable or disable major CodeRush features (like Caps as a 
	Modifier) for the way you work.
