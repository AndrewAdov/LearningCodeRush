	/* 
	Caps+Space is a powerful tool for compressing and expanding code. Use it to 
	work with expression bodies, ternary or null coalescing expressions, block 
	delimiters, conditionals, implicit/explicit variable declarations, and a 
	host of other code-toggling features.

	You also got an introduction to Smart Nav (Caps + arrow keys). Good job!
