/* 
	This project (CapsModifier) contains source files to help you learn
	CodeRush features, as well as shortcuts to invoke them.

	While examples in this project show how to instantly refactor code, 
	all the refactorings can be accessed through Visual Studio's Code 
	Action menu (use Ctrl+. or Num 0).

	Be sure to run the Setup Wizard if you haven't yet. It's the fastest 
	way to enable/disable major CodeRush features for the way you work:

		![](CodeRushSetup;crcommand:RunSetupWizard;;0.04,0.04)  << Start the Setup Wizard
