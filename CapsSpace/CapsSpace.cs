	/*
	Caps+Space is a toggling/conversion tool for your code.

	Use Caps+Space to compress to (or expand from):

		* Implicit/Explicit Declarations
		* Expression Bodies
		* Ternary Expressions
		* Null Coalescing Operations
		* Initializers

	And you can use Caps+Space to flatten conditionals, inline 
	temporary variables, simplify expressions, and so much more!

	Examples follow below. Arrows (![](ArrowDown;;;0.008,0.008)) will show caret position.

	Move to where the arrow points before pressing the shortcut.
